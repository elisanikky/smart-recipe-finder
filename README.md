## Project Idea

Smart Recipe Finder is a responsive web application that helps users discover recipes based on ingredients they already have at home. The application allows users to search for recipes, filter results by cuisine type, save their favorite recipes for future reference and explore new culinary ideas with a random recipe generator.
